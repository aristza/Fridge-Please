# Fridge-Please

## Project Overview

**Fridge-Please** is an innovative smart fridge solution designed to streamline the way you manage your kitchen inventory. Utilizing RFID stickers and advanced weight scales, this smart fridge can detect when products enter or leave, and measure how much of each product remains. Paired with a user-friendly application, Fridge-Please offers a comprehensive overview of your fridge’s contents, temperature control, and food management features, including recipe suggestions based on available ingredients.

## Features

### Product Detection and Tracking

- **RFID Stickers**: Each product in the fridge is tagged with an RFID sticker, allowing the system to detect when it enters or leaves the fridge.
- **Weight Scales**: Scales installed on each shelf measure the quantity of products remaining in the fridge.

### Application Integration

- **Inventory Display**: The application displays the type and amount of products currently in the fridge.
- **Temperature Control**: Users can view and set the temperature of the fridge through the application.
- **Product Log**: The application maintains a log of all products entering and leaving the fridge, providing a detailed history of your inventory.
- **Recipe Suggestions**: Based on the products in your fridge, the application suggests recipes using a free API, helping you decide what to cook with available ingredients.

## Adaptability

While the initial proof of concept focuses on a smart fridge, the technology behind Fridge-Please is versatile and can be adapted for other uses, including:

- **Wardrobes**: Manage and track your clothing inventory.
- **Kitchen Cabinets**: Keep an eye on your pantry items.
- **Supermarkets and Warehouses**: Monitor and manage large-scale inventory with ease.

## How It Works

1. **Product Entry/Exit Detection**: When a product with an RFID sticker enters or leaves the fridge, the RFID sensors detect this change and update the inventory in real-time.
2. **Weight Measurement**: Scales on each shelf continuously measure the weight of products, providing precise information on how much of each item is left.
3. **Data Synchronization**: All data is synchronized with the accompanying application, ensuring you always have up-to-date information about your fridge's contents.
4. **User Interaction**: Through the application, users can interact with their fridge’s data, set temperatures, view logs, and get recipe suggestions.

## Future Development

Fridge-Please aims to evolve and expand its capabilities, including:

- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Further adaptation for various storage environments beyond fridges.
- **Expanded API Integrations**: Integration with more APIs for advanced features such as nutritional information, expiration date tracking, and more personalized recipe suggestions.
- **User Feedback**: Incorporating user feedback to refine and improve the application and smart fridge system.
